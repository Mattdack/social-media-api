## Description
This application provides the database structure and routing for a basic social media website. It defines the get, post, update, and delete functionality for users and their thoughts, which are analogous to tweets. It also allows users to add friends and provide reactions to their or other users thoughts. This database structure and functionality is achieved with the express and mongoose node packages.

## Installation
After cloning the repository for this application, users will want to open the application directory in the code editor of their choice  and open the index.js file in an integrated terminal. There, they can run the commands npm init -y and npm i to install the necessary packages and their dependencies in the working directory.

## Usage
After following the above mentioned installation directions, users can invoke the server and database with the commands npm run start or npm run dev or node index.js. After the server becomes live, users will have to utilize a third party software like insomnia to make the get, post, update, delete requests or they will have to write their own fetch requests and front end interactions to make changes to data on the server.
